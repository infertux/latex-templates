# LaTeX templates

_LaTeX_ is probably the best way to produce nice-looking documents but you often find yourself cargo-culting your templates for each document.
This repository aims to provide clean and well-commented templates to get started in a breeze.
Each template includes a handy `.gitignore` and a `Makefile` so you just need to type `make` in order to generate the PDF.


## Setup

If you don't already have a working environment to compile _LaTeX_ documents, here are quick instructions to install the requirements.

### Arch Linux

Install the package `texlive-core` for the essentials or the group `texlive-most` to get everything.

### Fedora

Since Fedora 18, _TeX Live_ 2012 is part of the mainline distribution and can be installed with the package `texlive`.
Additional packages are available and are usually named `texlive-{package}`.

### Mac OS

The recommenced way is to use _MacTeX_ which is a redistribution of _TeX Live_ packaged for Mac OS.
